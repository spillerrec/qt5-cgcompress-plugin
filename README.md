qt5-cgcompress-plugin
==============

Qt5 plug-in for reading cgCompress images in Qt's image framework. This is a fork of https://github.com/spillerrec/qt5-ora-plugin

cgCompress files are generated by https://github.com/spillerrec/cgCompress and more details about the format can be found there.

### Building

**Dependencies**

- Qt5
- qmake
- libarchive
- pugixml (included)

**Building**

1. qmake
2. make

**Installation**

After successful compilation you should have a cgompress.* file (extension dependent on OS). You can install this globally or application specific. If the file is placed in Qt's plug-in folder under *imageformats*, it will be available to all Qt5 applications. To only use it with a specific application, create a folder called *imageformats* in the executables folder and place the plug-in there.
